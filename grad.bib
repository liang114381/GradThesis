Jagadeesh et al. describe a solution that combines a protocol from modern cryptography with frequency-based clinical genetics used to diagnose causal disease mutations in patients with monogenic disorders. This framework correctly identified the causal gene in cases involving actual patients, while protecting more than 99\% of individual participants{\textquoteright} most private variants.Science, this issue p. 692Patient genomes are interpretable only in the context of other genomes; however, genome sharing enables discrimination. Thousands of monogenic diseases have yielded definitive genomic diagnoses and potential gene therapy targets. Here we show how to provide such diagnoses while preserving participant privacy through the use of secure multiparty computation. In multiple real scenarios (small patient cohorts, trio analysis, two-hospital collaboration), we used our methods to identify the causal variant and discover previously unrecognized disease genes and variants while keeping up to 99.7\% of all participants{\textquoteright} most sensitive genomic information private.},

	title = {Deep learning with feature embedding for compound-protein interaction prediction},
	year = {2016},
	doi = {10.1101/086033},
	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
	abstract = {Accurately identifying compound-protein interactions in silico can deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action and significantly facilitate the drug discovery and development process. Traditional similarity-based computational models for compound-protein interaction prediction rarely exploit the latent features from current available large-scale unlabelled compound and protein data, and often limit their usage on relatively small-scale datasets. We propose a new scheme that combines feature embedding (a technique of representation learning) with deep learning for predicting compound-protein interactions. Our method automatically learns the low-dimensional implicit but expressive features for compounds and proteins from the massive amount of unlabelled data. Combining effective feature embedding with powerful deep learning techniques, our method provides a general computational pipeline for accurate compound-protein interaction prediction, even when the interaction knowledge of compounds and proteins is entirely unknown. Evaluations on current large-scale databases of the measured compound-protein affinities, such as ChEMBL and BindingDB, as well as known drug-target interactions from DrugBank have demonstrated the superior prediction performance of our method, and suggested that it can offer a useful tool for drug development and drug repositioning.},
